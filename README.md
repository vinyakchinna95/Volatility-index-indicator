# Volatility-index-indicator
the VIX Indicator (Volatility Index), often referred to as the "Fear Gauge," measures market volatility based on options prices. It represents the expected volatility in the U.S. stock market over the next 30 days, specifically the S&P 500 index options. A higher VIX value typically indicates increased market uncertainty or fear, while a lower value suggests stability or confidence in the market.

In our project, we have set specific thresholds for decision-making based on the VIX value:

* Below 15: Market conditions are considered stable or calm, and the process can continue as planned.
* 15 to 16: Market conditions are slightly volatile but still acceptable to proceed with the process.
* Above 16: If the VIX crosses this threshold, the market is considered too volatile, and your system will halt or not proceed with the next steps to avoid risks.

This approach helps in assessing the market environment before making any further decisions, ensuring that the system operates in a less uncertain market condition.
